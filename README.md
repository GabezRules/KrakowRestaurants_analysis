# Krakow restaurants analysis
How the location and menu options affect the popularity and ratings of visitors? Data that I collect, analyze and visualize by myself - to learn.

Repo will include:
  * two csv files with restaurant data and reviews left by users,
  * two scrappers: one to get links to restaurants and one to get reviews and data of specific restaurants
  * analysis of the files where I will try to answer the questions asked before
  * a ML model to predict the rating of the restaurant based on location and options like cuisine type or prices
  
Technologies used so far: Python 3, Selenium, BeautufilSoup, Matplotlib, Seaborn
